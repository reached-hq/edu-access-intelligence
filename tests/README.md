# Tests

Run the complete local suite from the repository root:

```bash
python -m pytest tests -q
```

| Location | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `factories/` | Python builders that create deterministic, made-up inputs in temporary directories |
| `data/` | Small static, made-up files when a factory is not practical |
| `test_repo_policy.py` | Data, secret, environment, and file-size rules |
| `test_documentation_structure.py` | Required indexes, retired paths, and local Markdown links |
| `test_naming.py` | Naming configuration and ETL path conventions |
| `test_ingestion_*.py` | Delivery validation, loading, rerun, and source-specific behavior |
| `test_silver.py` | DepEd enrollment Silver: cleaning rules, quarantine, the gate, the run record, revisions, and the generated SQL |
| `test_silver_psa.py` | PSA Poverty Stat Silver on made-up workbooks: unpivot, ID padding, region banners, NULL and `no_estimate`, full-precision numbers, statistical flags, quarantine, every gate check, revisions and new years, repeated rebuilds, the run record, and the generated files |
| `test_silver_personnel.py` | Personnel Silver typing, blank-versus-zero retention, principal-total flag, enrollment quarantine, reconciliation, and quality-result counts |
| `test_bundle.py`, `test_databricks_runtime.py` | The job's commit tracking and task order, and the Databricks runtime differences imitated locally |

Tests must never depend on real source rows or credentials.
