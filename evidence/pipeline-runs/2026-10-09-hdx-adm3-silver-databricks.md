# Evidence: HDX ADM3 Silver builds and passes its gate on Databricks, and a second run rebuilds the same result

Issue #90 · Databricks `dev` · 2026-10-09 · checked by @saraevcldn

## The claim

The two Silver SQL tasks of `edu_access_pipeline` for `hdx_boundaries`, run by Spark on the SQL warehouse, build `hdx_adm3_clean` and `hdx_adm3_quarantine` from the current Bronze batch: 1,642 clean rows, 0 quarantined, and all 38 gate checks PASS. Every geometry function in the generated SQL (`try_to_geometry`, `st_geometrytype`, `st_isempty`, `st_isvalid`, `st_contains`) runs on Databricks as written (D-035). A second run, on the same Bronze rows and the same commit, records a second `succeeded` run with the same counts and results.

## What was run

The job `[dev sara_celadina] edu_access_pipeline` (job `413860742211114`), deployed with `databricks bundle deploy --target dev --profile reached-hq` from the pushed branch `feat/90-hdx-adm3-silver` at commit `853be19d9a6ff3f19a2ecb40944f174e37eec533` (the `code_revision` every Bronze task printed). The HDX Silver tasks `06_clean_hdx_adm3` and `90_validate_hdx_adm3_clean` are enabled in that commit. The run was announced to the team and the SQL warehouse was stopped beforehand. The job was run twice with `databricks bundle run edu_access_pipeline --target dev --profile reached-hq`. Times are Manila (UTC+8).

| | Run 1 | Run 2 |
|---|---|---|
| Job run (`run_id` of the Silver rows) | `200962982110857` | `1120928216115214` |
| Whole job | 18:37:09 to 18:43:23, about 6 min 14 s, `TERMINATED SUCCESS` | 18:45:26 to 18:49:53, about 4 min 27 s, `TERMINATED SUCCESS` |
| `bronze_hdx_boundaries` | `hdx_boundaries__2025-02-13__f682747fbb26` skip, 0 inserted, Bronze 1,642 | same |
| `90_validate_hdx_adm3_raw`, `06_clean_hdx_adm3`, `90_validate_hdx_adm3_clean` | succeeded | succeeded |
| Other lanes | every Bronze load skipped (already loaded); DepEd enrollment Silver rebuilt and passed | same |

## Results

After run 2, on the SQL warehouse:

| `job_run_id` | `pipeline_runs.status` | clean rows | quarantined | PASS | WARN | FAIL |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `200962982110857` | succeeded | 1642 | 0 | 38 | 0 | 0 |
| `1120928216115214` | succeeded | 1642 | 0 | 38 | 0 | 0 |

The clean and quarantine counts are of the published tables after run 2 (the tables hold the last passing build); the check counts are per run from `data_quality_results` (`layer = 'silver'`).

Content of the published clean table after run 2, without the run stamp:

| rows | content MD5 | `run_id` |
|---:|---|---|
| 1642 | `1129f8ad489148fbda904e42936c4807` | `1120928216115214` |

The next run on the same Bronze rows should give the same MD5.

Geometry functions on `hdx_adm3_raw`, read-only, before the runs (5 rows): every row `parsed = true`, `kind = MULTIPOLYGON`, `valid = true`, `centre_inside = true`.

## What this does not show

- The content MD5 was taken once, after run 2, so it shows run 2's content, not a comparison with run 1. Both runs read the same Bronze batch (skipped, 1,642 rows) at the same commit and gave the same counts and check results.
- Nothing was quarantined or flagged on the real file, so quarantine, the flags, and a failing gate are shown by the local tests on made-up GeoJSON (`tests/test_silver_hdx.py`, 23 passed; full suite 525 passed, 1 skipped), not on Databricks.
- Per-task timings were not recorded.
