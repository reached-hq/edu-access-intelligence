# Coverage matrix

**Updated:** 2026-10-06 · Part of #8

One row per source: how it identifies places, its geographic level, years, time basis, grain, join keys, and how it reaches PSGC 2Q 2026, the master geography ([D-012](../../governance/decisions.md#d-012-which-psgc-version-to-use)). Sources still in open pull requests are included and marked.

Every number carries one evidence label:

- **Re-run:** computed from checksum-verified raw files by a script in this repository. Checks new to this matrix print under C-n from [`cross_source_coverage.py`](../../../analysis/cross_source/cross_source_coverage.py), and per source under BP-n ([barangay population](../../../analysis/cross_source/cross_source_psa_population_per_barangay.py)), AG-n ([age-group population](../../../analysis/cross_source/cross_source_psa_population_per_age_group.py)), CM-n ([CMCI](../../../analysis/cross_source/cross_source_dti_cmci.py)), and HB-n ([HDX boundaries](../../../analysis/cross_source/cross_source_hdx_boundaries.py)).
- **Card:** taken from the source's card, profile, or memo (merged or in an open pull request), not re-run here.
- **Not run:** nobody has computed it yet.

## Summary

1. **PSGC 2Q 2026 is the hub.** Every source reaches it at one of five levels: school (`school_id` through DepEd enrollment), barangay, city or municipality, province or HUC, and region. OSM reaches it only spatially, through the HDX boundaries.
2. **DepEd joins cleanly inside itself and mostly to PSGC.** All four DepEd school files join to enrollment on `school_id` with no loss, and 96.9% of SY 2023-24 schools reach a PSGC barangay by name (97.1% in SY 2024-25 and 2025-26, with the same rules; [year comparison](deped-year-comparison.md)).
3. **Poverty joins entirely, and 96 HDX ADM3 units partly, through PSGC's old 9-digit `Correspondence Code`.** The PSGC card still says not to join on that code, so the rule needs updating (see [Conflicts](#conflicts-between-documents)).
4. **Every acquired name-only or code-only source now has a match rate,** including the HDX boundaries: ADM3 1,634 of 1,642 and ADM4 99.7%, both one-to-one, but only when names are checked as well as codes, since COD-AB uses some PSGC code numbers for different units (Maguindanao, Manila). PSA barangay population: 99.87% by name, and every barangay accounted for. CMCI: 1,634 of 1,634, one-to-one. The age-group table's API codes are PSGC 2Q 2026 codes. Only FLEMMS cannot be tested, until the microdata is accessed.
5. **Two gaps change school-level results:** 5,476 located schools (9.3%) sit in the 44 cities and municipalities with no poverty estimate, and the 112 Special Geographic Area schools match Region XII municipalities, so any city- or municipality-level value attached to them is wrong (see [Limits](#what-limits-the-joins)).
6. **CHED is profiled but out of scope** ([D-003](../../governance/decisions.md#d-003-higher-education-is-out-of-scope)), so its rows are for the record only.

## Join paths

| Level | Sources | Key | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| School | DepEd enrollment, facilities, personnel, ELLNA, NAT Grade 6 | `school_id` | Enrollment is the anchor and the only DepEd file with place names |
| Barangay | DepEd (through the name match), barangay population, HDX ADM4 | 10-digit PSGC | Barangay is the level the sponsor tests ([D-013](../../governance/decisions.md#d-013-who-the-stakeholders-are)) |
| City or municipality | Poverty, CMCI, HDX ADM3, and DepEd aggregated | First 7 digits of the barangay PSGC, plus `000` | Poverty through `Correspondence Code`; HDX by code checked against the name; CMCI by name |
| Province or HUC | Age-group population, FLEMMS, and DepEd aggregated | First 5 digits of the PSGC | HUCs have province-level codes, so totals by PSGC province already keep them separate. DepEd files independent cities under their province; the name match sends them to their own codes |
| Region | OpenSTAT, CHED, BPDA context | Explicit region map | Use DepEd's own region for SY 2023-24 (D-012) |
| Spatial | OSM, HDX geometry | Point or polygon in polygon | Needs school coordinates, which no acquired source has |

The intended path for every area source is `school_id → PSGC barangay → aggregate by PSGC code → area source`. No area source is joined directly to DepEd names.

### Population can attach by code

PSGC 2Q 2026 has a `2024 Population` column keyed by the 10-digit code. It holds the same 2024 census counts as the barangay workbooks:

- **Total:** PSGC barangays sum to 112,727,776, the same as the workbooks' geographic total (C-3, profile O-7).
- **Zero-population barangays:** 12 in both, with the same regional split (C-3, profile O-10).
- **Barangay by barangay:** of the 41,958 workbook barangays matched to PSGC by name, 41,957 have exactly PSGC's population (BP-3). The other 52 workbook barangays each pair with one PSGC barangay of the same population in the same province or HUC: spelling differences, the barangays of two renamed municipalities (San Isidro, now Sawata; Don Victoriano Chiongbian, now Don Victoriano), and two renamed barangays (BP-4).
- **The one-barangay difference:** the workbooks list San Rafael (637) and Dacanlao (7,046) in the City of Calaca; PSGC 2Q 2026 has only Dacanlao, with 7,683, their sum (BP-5).

So barangay population attaches by PSGC code with no name crosswalk. The workbooks are a check on the PSGC column, not the join.

The workbooks mark footnotes with superscript runs, which text extraction reads as plain digits (`Barangay 176-A 1`); this confirms the barangay profile's S-1. The match drops them from the workbooks' own formatting (BP-1).

## What limits the joins

| Limit | Size | Handling |
|---|---|---|
| DepEd schools not matched to a PSGC barangay | 1,845 of 60,134 (SY 2023-24) | Listed, never forced. They still count at city, municipality, or province level where those matched |
| Schools in a city or municipality with no poverty estimate | 5,476 of 59,110 schools with a matched city or municipality (9.3%): HUCs 5,301, Cotabato City 83, Isabela City 74, Pateros 18. Public schools: 2,607 of 47,818. Re-run (C-1) | Keep blank with reason `not_in_source`; never impute. HUC, Isabela, and Cotabato estimates exist in PSA's 2023 Official Poverty Statistics, a different method (direct estimation) |
| Special Geographic Area schools at city or municipality level | All 112 SY 2023-24 schools under `BARMM` / `NORTH COTABATO` match a Cotabato municipality in Region XII: Pikit 46, Midsayap 20, Pigkawayan 17, Kabacan 14, Carmen 12, Aleosan 3. Re-run (C-2) | A city- or municipality-level join (poverty, CMCI, ADM3) would give them those Region XII municipalities' values. Exclude them from such joins, or mark them, until their barangays are matched to the eight Special Geographic Area municipalities |
| Region changes since SY 2023-24 | 3,306 matched schools: Negros to NIR (2,725), Sulu to Region IX (469), and the 112 above. DepEd's own region also moves: NIR from SY 2024-25 (2,704 schools) and Sulu to Region IX from SY 2025-26 (477) | Take region from DepEd for SY 2023-24 (D-012). Trends across school years use PSGC 2Q 2026 region or province, never DepEd's region (Y-5) |
| Blank counts in SY 2025-26 | Senior High School columns blank for 47,352 schools and Kinder to Grade 10 for 1,403, where earlier years wrote 0. Separately, 120 schools that offer SHS have no SHS counts, and 46 schools have no counts at all | Blank is 0 only where the level is not offered; the rest are missing (Y-3) |
| Assessments are samples | ELLNA and NAT Grade 6 cover five regions only; none in BARMM | Report as selected schools, never as regional coverage |
| Population concepts differ | Barangay file: total population. Age-group file: household population, province or HUC and up | Never mix the two in one ratio. School-age measures stay at province or HUC level |
| Quarantined age-group cells | 38 `Both Sexes` cells and 19 all-age totals | Do not recalculate; keep out of joins |
| CMCI matches that rest on review | 17 suffix readings and 16 aliases (CM-2, CM-3) | A teammate checks the [list](generated/dti_cmci_psgc_match.md) once before Silver |
| No school coordinates | No acquired source has them | Spatial work (OSM, distance) waits for an official coordinate list |

## Time alignment with the SY 2023-24 anchor

| Source | Time | Relation to SY 2023-24 | Label to use |
|---|---|---|---|
| DepEd enrollment, facilities, personnel, ELLNA, NAT Grade 6 | SY 2023-24 | Same | SY 2023-24 |
| PSGC | 30 June 2026 | Later geography; names still match | "PSGC 2Q 2026" |
| Poverty | 2023 estimate | Same calendar year as the start of the school year; inputs are the 2023 FIES and January 2024 LFS | "Poverty 2023" next to "SY 2023-24"; not called the same period (open question 1) |
| Barangay and age-group population | 2024 census, 1 July 2024 | Just after SY 2023-24 ends | "2024 census" |
| FLEMMS | Fieldwork October 2024; attendance SY 2024-25 | One year later | Compare with DepEd SY 2024-25, or label the years apart |
| OpenSTAT | Most tables end SY 2022-23; school counts reach SY 2023-24 | Mostly earlier | Each table's own years |
| CMCI | 2023 and 2024 | Overlaps; meaning of the year not documented | "CMCI 2023" or "CMCI 2024"; never joined on `year` against school year |
| HDX boundaries | Valid 2025-02-13, before NIR | Geography between SY 2023-24 and PSGC 2Q 2026 | "COD-AB v03" |
| OSM | 2026-09-28 | Much later | "OSM 2026-09-28" |
| BPDA | SY 2018-19 to 2020-21, or undated | Earlier | Historical context only |

## Conflicts between documents

Statements that disagree across cards, memos, and the #8 thread, with the evidence that settles each one.

| # | Where | Says | Evidence | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [psa_psgc profile](../source-inventory/psa_psgc/profile.md) O-3 | "Do not join on" `Correspondence Code` | The poverty join (X-1, 1,612 of 1,612) and 96 HDX ADM3 units depend on it. PSGC S-2 calls it "supported, not confirmed". D-012 says to revisit when a source arrives with codes from another PSGC version, which poverty and HDX both do | Revisit D-012 to allow joins through `Correspondence Code` where a source carries old codes, and update O-3 (open question 4) |
| 2 | [BARMM memo](barmm-dataset-research.md), summary 5 | OSM has 3,572 school points | OSM also stores schools as areas: 3,572 points and 47,068 areas, 50,640 school IDs with no overlap (#39 card O-3) | Corrected in this pull request |
| 3 | #8 thread (CMCI) | 1,634 of 1,634 CMCI LGUs match non-SGA PSGC units | The claim holds, but no card showed it: #35 records only 1,472 found after removing the suffix. Re-run here (CM-3): 1,634 of 1,634 match one-to-one, but only with a suffix lookup (17 suffixes by review) and 16 reviewed aliases. A plain name match also makes one false match: `San Pedro` takes Bulalacao through its old name instead of the City of San Pedro | Use the match in [dti_cmci_psgc_match.md](generated/dti_cmci_psgc_match.md); try current names before old names in any national name match |
| 4 | #8 thread (CMCI and OSM summary table) | CMCI columns `lgu_name`, `capacity_of_school`, `educational`; join to Gold on `psgc_code + year` | The files have `lgu`, `capacity_of_school_services`, `education` (#35 profile O-7). `year` is the CMCI reference year, not a school year | Use the real column names. Join on PSGC code and record the CMCI year as an attribute |
| 5 | #8 thread (OSM summary table) | 49,245 area features (`school`, `kindergarten`, `college`, `university`), "all have names" | 49,245 is right for areas only (47,068 + 217 + 1,273 + 687). 646 area schools have blank names (#39 O-4). The point layer adds 3,572 schools. Colleges and universities are higher education, out of scope under D-003 | Count both layers, `school` only (plus kindergarten if the team keeps it), and count blank names |
| 6 | #38 card and #8 thread (HDX) | 1,500 of 1,642 ADM3 codes match PSGC exactly (91.35%); the rest break down as 96 + 19 + 18 + 1 + 8 | Re-run (HB-2): the breakdown holds, and the 2 Maguindanao spellings resolve by the name rules, so only the 8 Special Geographic Area units are left, as the thread said. But 16 of the 1,500 code matches are Maguindanao codes that name a different municipality in PSGC (COD-AB `PH1908711` is Parang; PSGC `1908711000` is Sultan Mastura), and 4 are renamed LGUs. At barangay level, 184 codes name a different barangay (118 Maguindanao, 66 Manila) | Never join COD-AB to PSGC on the code alone; check the name too, as `cross_source_hdx_boundaries.py` does. #38's profile should state this |
| 7 | #8 thread (OSM comment) | The "DepEd EBEIS masterlist" lacks usable coordinates | No EBEIS masterlist is in the inventory. The DepEd files acquired have no coordinate columns at all | Name the file, or drop the reference |
| 8 | #8 thread (PSGC comment) | `Q4_2023` could bridge BPDA's pre-2024 geography | `Q4_2023` already has the Maguindanao split: the two provinces have no `Correspondence Code`, yet they are not among the 12 new codes without one (11 barangays and the NIR row, PSGC X-1), so their codes are in both files. It would not resolve BPDA's unsplit `Maguindanao`. It only keeps Sulu in BARMM, which the BARMM memo already handles by keeping the source region | No `Q4_2023` bridge needed; BPDA stays matched to 2Q 2026 as in the memo |
| 9 | [deped-dataset-research.md](deped-dataset-research.md) | Personnel and ELLNA come from open pull requests #40 and #49 | Both merged. Their card checksums equal the ones the script verifies, so the numbers stand | Point the memo at the merged cards (in #57) |
| 10 | #35 | Two folders, `cmci/` and `dti_cmci/`, with identical `profile.md` | One source should have one folder named after its `source_id` (D-006) | Remove `cmci/` in #35 |

## Open questions

1. **Poverty year:** label poverty 2023 next to SY 2023-24 (proposed), or treat them as one period?
2. **Missing poverty areas:** keep the 44 blank with reason `not_in_source` (proposed, and what the poverty card says), or acquire the 2023 Official Poverty Statistics for HUCs, Isabela, and Cotabato and accept a mixed method?
3. **Shared match columns:** one set for every place-name crosswalk (DepEd, barangay population, CMCI, BPDA) before Silver. Proposed:
   - `source_id`, `source_row_ref`, and the raw place fields, unchanged
   - `source_reference_date`
   - `psgc_version` (`2Q 2026`)
   - `psgc_code` (10 digits, blank when not matched)
   - `geographic_level` (`reg`, `prov`, `city_mun`, `bgy`)
   - `match_method` (`exact`, `old_name`, `folded`, `brackets_dropped`, `correspondence_code`, ...)
   - `match_status` (`matched`, `unmatched`, `ambiguous`, `not_in_source`, `excluded`)
   - `population_concept`, for population sources only (`total`, `household`)
4. **D-012 and `Correspondence Code`:** amend D-012 to allow joins through `Correspondence Code` for sources that carry old codes (poverty, HDX), and update PSGC O-3 (conflict 1).
5. **Special Geographic Area schools:** exclude the 112 from city- and municipality-level joins, or mark them, until their barangays are matched?
6. **OSM scope:** `school` only, or also `kindergarten`? Colleges and universities are out under D-003.
7. **Barangay population:** settled by BP-3 to BP-5. Use PSGC's `2024 Population` column; keep the workbooks as a check. Record as a decision?
8. **CMCI reviewed readings:** can Sara check the 17 suffix readings and 16 aliases in [dti_cmci_psgc_match.md](generated/dti_cmci_psgc_match.md)?

## Status against #8

| Done when | Status |
|---|---|
| One row per source: codes or names, level, years, time basis | Done for every acquired source, plus FLEMMS as a candidate |
| Grain statement and join keys per source | Done |
| Names-only sources matched to PSGC, match rate recorded | Done for DepEd (three years), BPDA, barangay population, age-group population, and CMCI. HDX ADM3 and ADM4 re-run here. FLEMMS cannot be tested. CHED not needed (D-003) |
| Unmatched records counted and listed | Listed for DepEd, BPDA, barangay population, and CMCI; poverty gaps named. Listed for HDX too (ADM3 8, ADM4 130, and 126 to review) |
| Enrollment compared across SY 2023-24 to 2025-26 | Done in [deped-year-comparison.md](deped-year-comparison.md): label mappings (Y-2), blank counts (Y-3), school IDs (Y-4), place changes (Y-5), and the PSGC match per year (Y-6). Lists in [deped_year_changes.md](generated/deped_year_changes.md) |
