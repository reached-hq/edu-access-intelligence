## Files

Raw files are kept in raw storage, never in git. Record exactly what arrived.

| File | Format | Encoding | Size (bytes) | Row count | SHA-256 | Raw storage location |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| `phl_admin3.geojson` | GeoJSON | UTF-8 | 555,585,099 | 1,642 | `f682747fbb26ba773131049ef61603f4b872ba93739f6e2c3320f55dd21eec41` | `RAW_DATA_DIR/admin_boundaries/` (team copy: Databricks volume `/Volumes/edu_access/00-source/raw/admin_boundaries/`) |
| `phl_admin4.geojson` | GeoJSON | UTF-8 | 710,191,069 | 42,048 | `4ebb5e3cf7b3245c659ea5886725e6a77ffc2d4bcbe3963d8f704d5adc5523d2` | `RAW_DATA_DIR/admin_boundaries/` (team copy: Databricks volume `/Volumes/edu_access/00-source/raw/admin_boundaries/`) |

### Rerunning the profile

- **Locally (default, D-007):** set `RAW_DATA_DIR` in the environment or the repo's `.env` to the folder that contains `admin_boundaries/phl_admin3.geojson` and `admin_boundaries/phl_admin4.geojson`, then run `python analysis/profiling/profile_boundaries.py` and `python analysis/profiling/dictionary_boundaries.py`.
- **On Databricks (alternative):** open both scripts from the team Git folder and run all cells. `RAW_DATA_DIR` is optional there; the scripts fall back to the team raw volume `/Volumes/edu_access/00-source/raw` (D-009).

Both profiling scripts verify the SHA-256 values before reading the files and stop on a mismatch.

## Raw storage and ingestion

- **Raw storage:** `phl_admin3.geojson` is the first download, so it stays flat in `/Volumes/edu_access/00-source/raw/admin_boundaries/` (D-016). Any later download (a new COD-AB edition, or a re-download of this one) goes into `raw/admin_boundaries/<download date>/` under its original name, with that folder's `SHA256SUMS.txt`, and never over an existing file.
- **Ingestion:** loaded to `` edu_access.`02-bronze`.hdx_adm3_raw `` from the contract [`config/ingestion/hdx_boundaries.json`](../../../../config/ingestion/hdx_boundaries.json) (format `geojson_features`), which pins the checksum and row count in [Files](#files). One Bronze row per feature, in file order (`source_row_number` 1 to 1,642). Every property is kept as text exactly as written in the file (numbers keep their digits, e.g. `112.2460`; JSON `null` stays NULL), and the geometry is kept as the raw GeoJSON text in the last column, `geometry`: not parsed, simplified, or reprojected.
- **Period:** the control tables' `school_year` column holds the file's reference date, `2025-02-13` (`valid_on`), the same way the PSA sources store their own periods there. Every feature's `valid_on` must equal it.
- **Blocking checks:** the approved checksum, a FeatureCollection with the contract's properties in order, a geometry on every feature, the reference date, and WGS 84 coordinates. **WARN:** a geometry type other than Polygon or MultiPolygon, or a byte-order mark.
- **`phl_admin4.geojson` is not ingested** in this step. The contract's file pattern matches only `phl_admin3.geojson`, so the ADM4 file beside it is ignored (`test_the_admin4_file_beside_it_is_ignored`). Adding it later is a separate contract and table.
- **Verified locally** on 2026-10-08 (1,642 rows, then a skip; 0 WARN, 0 FAIL); the Databricks confirmation run is pending.
- **Status stays `profiled`** until the team accepts the source.

## Publisher documentation

Documents the publisher provides about this data. Keep them with the raw files; do not commit them.

| Document | URL | SHA-256 | Sections relied on |
|---|---|---|---|
| COD-AB Philippines dataset page | [https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-phl](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-phl) | UNVERIFIED | Source identity and administrative-boundary metadata |

## Coverage

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Geographic coverage | Philippines |
| Geographic level (region / province / city-municipality / barangay / school) | ADM3 city/municipality; ADM4 barangay |
| Time coverage | `valid_on = 2025-02-13` |
| Time basis (school year / calendar year / reference date) | Administrative boundary validity date |
| Update frequency | UNVERIFIED |
| Population covered (e.g. public schools only) | Not applicable; geographic reference data |

## Structure

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Apparent grain (what one row represents) | One administrative boundary feature per ADM3 city/municipality or ADM4 barangay |
| Candidate primary key | `adm3_pcode` for ADM3; `adm4_pcode` for ADM4 |
| Candidate join keys | `adm3_pcode`, `adm4_pcode`, and parent administrative codes; PSGC joins require a validated crosswalk |
| PSGC available? Which version? | No official PSGC identifiers in the source; source contains administrative PCODEs. PSA PSGC 2Q 2026 was used only for compatibility checking. |
| Personally identifiable or sensitive fields | None observed |
| Provenance fields in the source | `valid_on`, `valid_to`, `version`, administrative hierarchy fields |

## Known quality problems

Summary only; evidence lives in [profile.md](profile.md). Label each one **observed** or **suspected**.

- **Observed:** No missing or duplicate ADM3/ADM4 administrative codes were found.
- **Observed:** No missing, empty, or invalid geometries were found in either layer.
- **Observed:** Both layers use EPSG:4326 (WGS 84).
- **Observed:** The ADM3 structural code comparison with the PSA PSGC 2Q 2026 publication matched 1,500 of 1,642 records (91.35%); 142 did not have an exact structural match.
- **Suspected:** ADM3 boundary codes may require a validated PSGC crosswalk before being treated as official PSGC identifiers.
- **Suspected:** The boundary source version may not represent the same geographic edition as the current PSGC publication.
- **Suspected:** Administrative names should not be used as the primary join key when a geographic or validated code-based join is available.

## Limitations for analysis

What this source cannot support, or supports only with caveats.

- This is geographic reference data and does not contain education enrollment, capacity, population, or education outcomes.
- The boundary source should not be treated as the project's authoritative PSGC reference.
- Current PSGC identifiers should only be assigned through a validated crosswalk.
- The 142 ADM3 records without an exact structural PSGC match should not be force-mapped by name alone.
- Spatial joins should be performed using the boundary geometry rather than relying on administrative names alone.
- Geographic boundaries may not exactly match the geographic editions used by other project datasets.
- ADM4 should only be used for barangay-level analysis where the underlying project data supports that geographic level.
