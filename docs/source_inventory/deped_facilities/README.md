|---|---|
| Geographic coverage | Philippines |
| Geographic level | School only. **No location columns**; location comes from `deped_enrollment` via `school_id` |
| Time coverage | **SY 2023-24 only** (no other year is published on the page) |
| Time basis | School year |
| Update frequency | Collected annually (Technical Notes p. 3); only one year published |
| Population covered | **Public schools only** for all facility measures (Technical Notes p. 3, 12; confirmed in the data) |

## Structure

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Apparent grain | One row per school, SY 2023-24 |
| Candidate primary key | `school_id` |
| Candidate join keys | `school_id` to `deped_enrollment` SY 2023-24 (60,167 of 60,167 match) |
| PSGC available? | No, and no location names either |
| Personally identifiable or sensitive fields | None |
| Provenance fields in the source | None |

### Expected vs actual schema

| Column group | Expected (README) | Actual | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| School information | 6 columns | matches | Same values as enrollment for every school |
| Classroom, building, temporary space counts | nullable integers | 21 columns, all whole numbers, none negative | Blank for all non-public schools |
| Amenities, road, transport access | nullable booleans | 60 columns with values `True`, `False`, or blank | 34.6% to 96.1% blank per column |

## Known quality problems

See [profile.md](profile.md) for evidence.

- **Observed:** facility measures exist for public schools only.
- **Observed:** 669 public schools that offer elementary have no elementary classroom count, and no school records 0 elementary classrooms.
- **Observed:** the "instructional classroom" definition here is broader than the one DepEd uses for its classroom-learner ratio.
- **Suspected:** extreme learner-per-room values point to classroom undercounts or reporting errors.

## Limitations for analysis

- Any capacity measure covers **public schools only** and **SY 2023-24 only**.
- `*_classrooms_instructional` includes ALS rooms, audio-visual rooms, computer rooms, and laboratories (README). DepEd's classroom-learner ratio uses Kindergarten to Grade 12 classrooms only (Technical Notes p. 11). A ratio computed from this file will show **fewer learners per room than DepEd's official figure** and must be named accordingly, e.g. "learners per instructional room (NSBI definition)".
- No official standard or ideal ratio is given in the Technical Notes. None may be applied without a cited source.
