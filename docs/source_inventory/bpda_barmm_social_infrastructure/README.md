## Files

Raw files are kept outside git. Row count excludes the header and empty formatted rows.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `BARMM_Social_Infrastructure.xlsx` | XLSX, one worksheet | n/a | 31,251 | 9 | `6af9c99e33d820f99eb554326eb126cf6a2cdb30945e8f11088a0b26197391d3` | `raw-data/bpda/original/`; governed raw-storage upload pending |

## Publisher documentation

| Document | URL | SHA-256 | Sections relied on |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bangsamoro Knowledge Portal: Infrastructure Development in BARMM | https://knowledge.bpda.bangsamoro.gov.ph/open-data/bangsamoro-ecological-profile/infrastructure | Live web resource; checksum not captured | Publisher, dataset title, placement in the Bangsamoro Ecological Profile, download link |
| Workbook header | Inside the inventoried file | File checksum above | Exact measure names, the few stated reference periods, and units |

No methodology, source note, geographic definition, dash-marker definition, or release note accompanies the workbook.

## Coverage

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Geographic coverage | Nine historical BARMM reporting areas: Maguindanao, Lanao del Sur, Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, Cotabato City, Special Geographic Area (SGA), Lamitan City, and Marawi City |
| Geographic level | Mixed provinces, cities, and SGA |
| Time coverage | Mixed. Private/public elementary schools are labeled 2019-2021; permanent elementary classroom buildings are labeled as of 2022; hospital, RHU, and BHS facilities are labeled 2011-2021. Most education and other measures have no stated reference period |
| Time basis | Mixed period and as-of counts; row-level dates are absent |
| Update frequency | **UNVERIFIED** |
| Population covered | Education fields cover private/public elementary and secondary schools, private madaris, classroom buildings, selected school facilities, SUCs, and ministry-supervised HEIs. Sector definitions and institutional coverage are **UNVERIFIED** |

## Structure

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Apparent grain | One wide row per published province/city/SGA label, with 32 count measures across education and other social-infrastructure domains |
| Candidate primary key | Raw `Province/City`; 9 rows and 0 duplicates |
| Candidate join keys | Historical reporting-area label plus measure-specific reference period where known. A governed historical-geography bridge is required |
| PSGC available? Which version? | No codes. The geography uses unsplit Maguindanao, includes SGA as a separate row, and includes Sulu in BARMM |
| Personally identifiable or sensitive fields | None. Public aggregate facility counts only. Classification: **Public** |
| Provenance fields in the source | Worksheet name, row number, exact measure header, and reporting-area label. No publication date, revision, source agency per column, or extraction timestamp appears inside the workbook |

Column-by-column descriptions, fill rates, and ranges: [data_dictionary.md](data_dictionary.md).

### Expected vs actual schema

| Column or structure | Expected type | Actual type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Province/City` | Geographic reporting area | Text | Unique, but mixes provinces, cities, and SGA |
| 32 measures | Nonnegative whole-number counts | 200 numeric values, 87 `-` markers, and 1 physical blank | All 200 numeric values are whole numbers; 4 are explicit zeroes |
| Numeric formatting | Clean number | Three numeric-looking cells contain a leading non-breaking space | Normalize Unicode whitespace after retaining raw text |
| Worksheet extent | Header plus 9 rows | 1,000 physical rows, of which 990 are empty formatted rows | Ignore only rows with no populated cells |
| Geographic code | PSGC | Absent | Manual, versioned crosswalk required |

## Lineage and dependencies

Unstated originating ministries/systems -> BPDA Bangsamoro Ecological Profile Google Sheet -> public XLSX export -> checksum-verified raw storage -> header, type, missing-marker, and reconciliation checks -> education-field selection with raw lineage -> historical reporting-area bridge -> descriptive infrastructure indicators.

## Known quality problems

- **Observed:** 87 of 288 measure cells contain `-`, but the publisher does not define whether it means zero, not applicable, not available, or not reported. The profile treats it as null.
- **Observed:** one cell is physically blank, distinct from the 87 dash markers.
- **Observed:** three numeric-looking cells contain leading non-breaking spaces.
- **Observed:** the sheet has 990 empty formatted rows after the 10 non-empty rows.
- **Observed:** the semi-permanent elementary classroom-building header says `as of 20222`, an apparent typo that remains uncorrected in raw data.
- **Observed:** the 21 education columns mix stated periods and no-date measures. Values cannot be assumed to share one reference year.
- **Observed:** classroom measures count **classroom buildings**, not rooms, seats, capacity, utilization, or condition.
- **Observed:** no PSGC or other geographic code is supplied; the geography is historical and mixed-level.
- **Observed:** `Number of SUCs and Elementary Schools` is ambiguous and cannot be interpreted safely from the header alone.
- **Observed:** private elementary and private secondary school counts are identical in 5 of 9 rows (Maguindanao 88, Lanao del Sur 57, Basilan 13, Sulu 15, Tawi-Tawi 18). The other four rows differ. At least one column is probably a copy error, so both are excluded until BPDA confirms them.
- **Observed:** four permanent classroom-building counts are far out of line with school counts: Cotabato City elementary has 34.2 buildings per public school, SGA elementary 16.3, Lamitan City secondary 70.1, and Marawi City secondary 38.4, against 1.2 to 5.7 elsewhere.

## Limitations for analysis

- The source is suitable for historical descriptive context at a broad reporting-area level. It is not school-level operational data.
- It cannot support distance or travel-time analysis because it has no school addresses, coordinates, barangay, or road geometry.
- It cannot support classroom crowding or learner-to-classroom ratios: it counts buildings and supplies no learners, classrooms, seats, or design capacity at the same grain and date.
- It cannot support teacher workload because it has no teacher or personnel counts.
- Measures with unspecified reference periods must not be combined into a same-year model.
- Dashes must not be converted to zero without publisher confirmation.
- Private elementary and private secondary school counts must not be used until BPDA confirms which values are correct.
- Areas must not be ranked on classroom-building counts until BPDA explains the four outlying values.
- Non-education fields are out of project scope but remain documented because they arrived in the same source file.

## Recommended controls and monitoring

- Fail ingestion if the checksum, 33-column header, 9-row roster, or reporting-area key changes without re-inventory.
- Preserve raw text, including `-` and non-breaking spaces, alongside normalized numeric values.
- Treat `-` and physical blank as separate null-reason states until BPDA defines them.
- Select education fields explicitly; do not ingest every measure into the education fact model by accident.
- Attach a measure-level reference period and source-status field; mark unstated dates as unknown.
- Build a dated reporting-area bridge and record the match method; never force the rows onto current PSGC geography.
- Obtain data definitions, source ministry/system, dates, dash semantics, and clarification of the ambiguous/typo headers before using this as primary evidence.
