## Publisher documentation

| Document | URL | SHA-256 | Sections relied on |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bangsamoro Knowledge Portal: BARMM Population and Social Services | https://knowledge.bpda.bangsamoro.gov.ph/open-data/bangsamoro-ecological-profile/population-and-social-services | Live web resource; checksum not captured | Publisher, dataset title, placement in the Bangsamoro Ecological Profile, download link |
| Workbook header | Inside the inventoried file | File checksum above | Exact indicator names, education levels, and school years |

No methodology, formulas, definitions, data-source note, or release note accompanies the workbook.

## Coverage

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Geographic coverage | Ten historical BARMM reporting areas: Basilan, Lamitan City, Lanao del Sur I and II, Maguindanao I and II, Marawi City, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, and Cotabato City |
| Geographic level | Mixed province-like and school-division reporting areas; not a current province table |
| Time coverage | Net enrolment rate: SY 2018-2019 to 2020-2021. Completion and cohort-survival rates: SY 2019-2020 to 2020-2021 |
| Time basis | School year |
| Update frequency | **UNVERIFIED** |
| Population covered | Elementary and secondary education, with kindergarten, JHS, and SHS detail for net enrolment. Public/private and learner-population scope are **UNVERIFIED** |

## Structure

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Apparent grain | One wide row per published province / school-division label, with 20 indicator-period columns |
| Candidate primary key | Raw `Province / School Division`; 10 rows and 0 duplicates |
| Candidate join keys | Historical reporting-area label plus school year. A governed school-division bridge is required; do not join these labels directly to current PSGC names |
| PSGC available? Which version? | No codes. The labels reflect historical divisions and geography, include Sulu under BARMM, and predate the Maguindanao province split. PSGC 2Q 2026, the team's master reference ([D-012](../../decisions.md#d-012-which-psgc-version-to-use)), lists Sulu under Region IX and Maguindanao as del Norte and del Sur ([psa_psgc README](../psa_psgc/README.md#version-used-and-sy-2023-24)) |
| Personally identifiable or sensitive fields | None. Public aggregate rates only. Classification: **Public** |
| Provenance fields in the source | Worksheet name, row number, exact header, reporting-area label, and school year embedded in each header. No source agency, publication date, revision, or extraction timestamp appears inside the workbook |

Column-by-column descriptions, fill rates, and ranges: [data_dictionary.md](data_dictionary.md).

### Expected vs actual schema

| Column or structure | Expected type | Actual type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Province / School Division` | Reporting-area identifier | Text | Unique, but mixes provinces, cities, and numbered school divisions |
| 20 rate columns | Percentage | Numeric decimal fractions | 192 of 200 cells filled; range 3.62% to 107.86% |
| Missing values | Null or documented marker | Physically blank cells | All eight blanks are Cotabato City completion and cohort-survival fields |
| Geographic code | PSGC or school-division code | Absent | Manual, versioned crosswalk required |

## Lineage and dependencies

Unstated originating agency/system -> BPDA Bangsamoro Ecological Profile Google Sheet -> public XLSX export -> checksum-verified raw storage -> header and rate validation -> long-form normalization with reporting-area and school-year lineage -> historical school-division bridge -> contextual access and progression indicators.

## Known quality problems

- **Observed:** the workbook contains no definitions, formulas, numerators, denominators, source note, release date, or region totals.
- **Observed:** 8 of 200 rate cells are blank. They are all Cotabato City completion and cohort-survival values for SY 2019-2020 and 2020-2021.
- **Observed:** Lamitan City has elementary net enrolment rates above 100% in all three years: 107.02%, 107.86%, and 101.52%. These values are retained, not clipped.
- **Observed:** Marawi City cohort-survival rates for SY 2019-2020 are exactly 100% for both elementary and secondary. No other rate cell equals 100%. These values are retained and flagged as possible caps or placeholders.
- **Observed:** the only geographic identifier is a mixed reporting-area label. No PSGC or school-division code is supplied.
- **Observed:** the historical labels are incompatible with a direct current-PSGC join: Maguindanao is represented as Divisions I and II, while Sulu is part of the delivered BARMM table. In PSGC 2Q 2026, Sulu is under Region IX and Maguindanao is split into del Norte and del Sur ([psa_psgc README](../psa_psgc/README.md#version-used-and-sy-2023-24), [psa_psgc profile O-3](../psa_psgc/profile.md)).
- **Observed:** one header omits a space in `SY2020-2021`; this is a schema-label inconsistency, not a different time period.

## Limitations for analysis

- The source is suitable for historical, descriptive comparison of published rates across BARMM school divisions. It is not a current operational dataset.
- Rates cannot be re-aggregated to a BARMM total or weighted by population because no numerators or denominators are supplied.
- The file cannot support school-level analysis, distance analysis, class-size analysis, teacher workload, or causal claims about learning outcomes.
- The source contains access and progression indicators, not National Achievement Test or other learner-assessment scores.
- Cross-year comparison spans the COVID-19 period and must not be interpreted as a normal trend without contextual evidence.

## Recommended controls and monitoring

- Fail ingestion if the checksum, one-sheet structure, 21-column header, 10-row roster, or reporting-area key changes without re-inventory.
- Preserve exact source headers and labels alongside normalized indicator, level, and school-year fields.
- Keep blanks as null and values at or above 100% unchanged but flagged.
- Build a dated school-division bridge and record match method; never substitute current PSGC regions silently.
- Obtain MBHTE/BPDA definitions, numerators, denominators, public/private scope, release date, and explanations for the Lamitan and Marawi values before using the rates as primary evidence.
