# ETL table registry

The machine-readable registry is [`config/tables.yml`](../../config/tables.yml).
It fixes source-aligned Bronze and Silver names for the datasets already known,
without pretending that the business problem or analytical questions are final.

## Finalized source-aligned names

| Dataset | Bronze table | Silver table | Silver quarantine |
|---|---|---|---|
| DepEd enrollment, SY 2023-24 through 2025-26 | `deped_enrollment_raw` | `deped_enrollment_clean` | `deped_enrollment_quarantine` |
| DepEd facilities, SY 2023-24 | `deped_facilities_raw` | `deped_facilities_clean` | `deped_facilities_quarantine` |
| DepEd personnel, SY 2023-24 | `deped_personnel_raw` | `deped_personnel_clean` | `deped_personnel_quarantine` |
| PSA PSGC workbook, `PSGC` sheet | `psa_psgc_raw` | `psa_psgc_clean` | `psa_psgc_quarantine` |
| PSA poverty statistics | `psa_poverty_stat_raw` | `psa_poverty_stat_clean` | `psa_poverty_stat_quarantine` |
| HDX ADM3 boundaries | `hdx_adm3_raw` | `hdx_adm3_clean` | `hdx_adm3_quarantine` |

Implemented so far: the Bronze tables of DepEd enrollment and facilities, and
the Silver tables of DepEd enrollment ([Silver](../operations/silver.md)).

The three enrollment school years belong in one table. `school_year` identifies
the delivery year; it should not be encoded in separate table names. Likewise,
the PSGC workbook and its `PSGC` sheet are one logical input, not separate
tables. The HDX name includes `adm3` because the current scope is specifically
the city/municipality layer.

Fully qualified names use the catalog and layer schema. For example:

```sql
edu_access.`02-bronze`.deped_enrollment_raw
edu_access.`03-silver`.deped_enrollment_clean
```

## File names

Bronze and Silver use the source order recorded in `config/tables.yml`; the
same number follows a dataset across both layers. Validation gates use `90`
because dependency order belongs in `databricks.yml`, not in the gate prefix:

```text
NN_create_<source>_raw.sql
NN_clean_<source>.sql
90_validate_<table>.sql
```

The exact future file names are recorded beside each table in
`config/tables.yml`. A registry entry does not mean the SQL file has been
implemented.

## Integration drafts

These are working names only:

| Candidate table | Candidate file | Intended grain |
|---|---|---|
| `deped_school_psgc_map` | `01_map_deped_school_psgc.sql` | One reviewed DepEd school-geography mapping to PSGC |
| `psa_poverty_psgc_map` | `02_map_psa_poverty_psgc.sql` | One reviewed poverty-statistic geography mapping to PSGC |
| `hdx_adm3_psgc_map` | `03_map_hdx_adm3_psgc.sql` | One reviewed HDX ADM3 feature mapping to PSGC |

Do not create these tables until their keys, match statuses, review workflow,
and PSGC-version behavior are agreed. Gold and Analytics names remain deferred
until the business problem, analytical questions, measures, and grains are
approved.
