# Cross-source analysis

Work that compares or joins sources, with evidence: how each source reaches PSGC 2Q 2026, the master geography ([D-012](../decisions.md#d-012-which-psgc-version-to-use)), and what that means for joining them (#8). Findings about a single source stay in its own folder under [`docs/source_inventory/`](../source_inventory/). The scripts that produce these numbers live in [`notebooks/profiling/`](../../notebooks/profiling/), named `cross_source_*.py`.

Start with the [coverage matrix](coverage.md). It has one row per source and points to everything else.

## Contents

### Memos (written by hand, every number from a script)

| File | What it answers | Finding IDs | Script |
|---|---|---|---|
| [coverage.md](coverage.md) | For every source: how it names places, its level, years, grain, join keys, and PSGC match. Also join paths, limits, time alignment, conflicts between documents, and open questions | C, BP, AG, CM, HB | several, below |
| [deped_dataset_research.md](deped_dataset_research.md) | How DepEd SY 2023-24 place names match PSGC, and how the DepEd school files join on `school_id` | A, B | [`cross_source_deped.py`](../../notebooks/profiling/cross_source_deped.py) |
| [deped_year_comparison.md](deped_year_comparison.md) | What changes across DepEd enrollment SY 2023-24, 2024-25, and 2025-26: labels, blank counts, school IDs, places, and the PSGC match per year | Y | [`cross_source_deped_years.py`](../../notebooks/profiling/cross_source_deped_years.py) |
| [barmm_dataset_research.md](barmm_dataset_research.md) | What the BPDA, PSA, and other sources can say about BARMM, and how they join | none (BPDA label matches were done by hand) | none |

### Generated lists, in [`generated/`](generated/) (never edit by hand; rerun the script)

| File | Lists | Script |
|---|---|---|
| [deped_psgc_unmatched.md](generated/deped_psgc_unmatched.md) | DepEd SY 2023-24 place names not matched to PSGC, with school counts | [`cross_source_deped.py`](../../notebooks/profiling/cross_source_deped.py) |
| [deped_year_changes.md](generated/deped_year_changes.md) | School IDs dropped or added between years, place names that change for the same school, and names newly unmatched in later years | [`cross_source_deped_years.py`](../../notebooks/profiling/cross_source_deped_years.py) |
| [psa_population_psgc_unmatched.md](generated/psa_population_psgc_unmatched.md) | Barangay population rows not matched to PSGC by their exact name, and how each was settled | [`cross_source_psa_population_per_barangay.py`](../../notebooks/profiling/cross_source_psa_population_per_barangay.py) |
| [dti_cmci_psgc_match.md](generated/dti_cmci_psgc_match.md) | CMCI suffix readings, CMCI LGUs not matched by exact name, and PSGC units with no CMCI LGU | [`cross_source_dti_cmci.py`](../../notebooks/profiling/cross_source_dti_cmci.py) |

## How to read the evidence

### Evidence labels

Every number in the coverage matrix carries one label:

| Label | Meaning | Can it be rerun? |
|---|---|---|
| **Re-run** | Computed from checksum-verified raw files by a script in this repository | Yes: run the script and find the finding ID in its output |
| **Card** | Taken from a source card, profile, or memo, not recomputed for the matrix. "By hand" means no script produced it | Only through that source's own profiling script, if it has one |
| **Not run** | Nobody has computed it yet | No |

### Finding IDs

A finding ID such as `A-5` or `Y-6` is printed by a script in front of the number it reports, as `[A-5] ...`. A number in a memo carries the same ID, so it can be traced to the exact check and reproduced. The letters say which script prints it:

| Prefix | Printed by | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| `A-n` | `cross_source_deped.py` | DepEd SY 2023-24 place names to PSGC 2Q 2026 |
| `B-n` | `cross_source_deped.py` | DepEd `school_id` joins between enrollment, facilities, personnel, ELLNA, and NAT Grade 6 |
| `Y-n` | `cross_source_deped_years.py` | DepEd enrollment across the three acquired school years |
| `C-n` | `cross_source_coverage.py` | Checks that span sources: schools without a poverty estimate (C-1), Special Geographic Area schools (C-2), PSGC population (C-3) |
| `BP-n` | `cross_source_psa_population_per_barangay.py` | PSA barangay population against PSGC |
| `AG-n` | `cross_source_psa_population_per_age_group.py` | PSA age-group population's OpenSTAT codes against PSGC |
| `CM-n` | `cross_source_dti_cmci.py` | CMCI LGUs against PSGC |
| `HB-n` | `cross_source_hdx_boundaries.py` | COD-AB (HDX) boundaries against PSGC |
| `O-n`, `X-n`, `S-n` | each source's own profiling script | That source's `profile.md`: observed findings, cross-checks, and suspected findings |

Example: the coverage matrix says enrollment matches PSGC at 97.1% in SY 2024-25, with evidence "Re-run (Y-6)". Run `cross_source_deped_years.py` and read the line that starts `[Y-6] SY 2024-25`.

## How the work was done

The coverage matrix for #8 was built in these steps. New cross-source work should follow the same order.

1. **Inventory every source's place key.** From each source card: does it carry PSGC codes, other codes, or names only; at what level; for which years; and what one row means.
2. **Read every claim against its evidence.** Each number posted in the #8 thread was checked against the source's card, profile, and pull request reviews. Disagreements are recorded in the matrix under "Conflicts between documents", with the evidence that settles each one.
3. **Re-run what can be re-run.** For every acquired source, a script reads the checksum-verified raw files and matches them to PSGC 2Q 2026, using the shared rules below. Numbers that could not be re-run keep the label **Card**.
4. **Count and list what does not match.** Nothing is forced. Every unmatched or ambiguous record is counted in the memo and listed in a generated file, with its reason.
5. **Look for joins that would be wrong, not just missing.** A match can succeed and still be wrong. Each script checks for codes claimed twice, and code matches are checked against names.
6. **Record what limits the joins, and what the team must decide.** Gaps that change results (for example, schools in areas without a poverty estimate) go under "What limits the joins"; choices that are not ours to make alone go under "Open questions".

## Shared matching rules

All `cross_source_*.py` scripts reuse the rules in `cross_source_deped.py`, so every source is matched the same way. Each rule beyond an exact match is a separate, counted tier, so a stricter reader can drop it.

- **Match inside the parent, never on a name alone.** Province, then city or municipality inside the province, then barangay inside the city or municipality. Region is never a match key (D-012).
- **Tiers, in order:** exact name; PSGC `Old names`; accents and punctuation ignored; bracketed text dropped; the words "City" and "of" ignored. The DepEd memo lists the DepEd-specific extensions ([rules](deped_dataset_research.md#rules)).
- **A match must be unique.** Two or more candidates is "ambiguous", never a pick.
- **Current names before old names** when there is no parent to scope the search: otherwise an old name can take another place's match (CMCI's `San Pedro` matched Bulalacao, whose old name is San Pedro, instead of the City of San Pedro).
- **A code is not enough on its own.** COD-AB uses some PSGC code numbers for different places (Maguindanao, Manila), so a code match counts only if the names agree.
- **`Correspondence Code`** (PSGC's old 9-digit code) links sources that carry old codes: poverty, and the COD-AB units still coded under Regions VI and VII. Its use is pending a D-012 amendment (coverage matrix, open question 4).
- **Anything decided by review, not by the data,** such as a CMCI suffix reading or an alias, is written into the script, counted separately, and listed for a teammate to check.

## How to rerun

Every script runs locally, with no Databricks compute, from raw files in the folder named by `RAW_DATA_DIR` ([terminal setup, Part 8](../terminal_setup.md#part-8-raw-data-and-raw_data_dir)). Each script checks every file's SHA-256 against its source card and stops if one differs.

```bash
export RAW_DATA_DIR=~/Projects/reached-hq/raw-data
python notebooks/profiling/cross_source_deped.py
```

| Script | Needs under `RAW_DATA_DIR` |
|---|---|
| `cross_source_deped.py` | `deped/original/`: the SY 2023-24 enrollment, facilities, personnel, ELLNA, and NAT Grade 6 zips. `psa/original/`: the PSGC 2Q 2026 workbook |
| `cross_source_coverage.py` | Same as `cross_source_deped.py` |
| `cross_source_deped_years.py` | Same, plus the SY 2024-25 and 2025-26 enrollment zips |
| `cross_source_psa_population_per_barangay.py` | Same as `cross_source_deped.py`, plus the 18 regional barangay population workbooks in `psa/original/` |
| `cross_source_psa_population_per_age_group.py` | `psa/original/`: the age-group CSV, the PSGC 2Q 2026 workbook, and `0201A6DPAG0_metadata.json` (the OpenSTAT API metadata; the script header has the URL) |
| `cross_source_dti_cmci.py` | Same as `cross_source_deped.py`, plus `dti/original/cmci_lgu_list.csv` |
| `cross_source_hdx_boundaries.py` | Same as `cross_source_deped.py`, plus `admin_boundaries/original/phl_admin3.geojson` and `phl_admin4.geojson` (1.27 GB together) |

The raw files are on the team volume, `/Volumes/edu_access/00-source/raw/`, in folders named like the ones above (`deped`, `psa`, `cmci`, `admin_boundaries`). Copy them with the Databricks CLI and the `reached-hq` profile, for example:

```bash
databricks fs cp dbfs:/Volumes/edu_access/00-source/raw/cmci/cmci_lgu_list.csv "$RAW_DATA_DIR/dti/original/" --profile reached-hq
```

Running a script rewrites its generated list. If the list changes, the raw file or the rules changed: find out which before committing. The scripts that reuse `cross_source_deped.py` also rewrite `generated/deped_psgc_unmatched.md`, which should come out unchanged.

## Adding cross-source work

- **Script:** `notebooks/profiling/cross_source_<source_id>.py`, reading from `RAW_DATA_DIR`, checking checksums first, and reusing the matching rules above.
- **Finding IDs:** pick a new short prefix, add it to the table in this README, and print every number under its ID.
- **Lists:** write unmatched or ambiguous records to `docs/cross_source/generated/<source_id>_<what>.md`, with a first line saying which script generated it.
- **Coverage matrix:** update the source's row with the result, the list, and the evidence label and IDs; add any limit, conflict, or open question it raises.
- **This README:** add the memo or list to Contents.
