# Generates the source data dictionaries for deped_enrollment and deped_facilities:
#   docs/data/source-inventory/deped_enrollment/data_dictionary.md
#   docs/data/source-inventory/deped_facilities/data_dictionary.md
#
# Descriptions are copied from DepEd's README inside each zip. Everything else
# (how filled a column is, distinct values, samples, ranges) is measured from the
# data. Output is deterministic, so rerunning on the same files changes nothing.
#
#   RAW_DATA_DIR=~/Projects/reached-hq/raw-data python analysis/profiling/dictionary_deped.py
#
# The file list and loading repeat profile_deped.py on purpose for now; they move
# to src/profiling/ when a second publisher needs the same code (D-007).
