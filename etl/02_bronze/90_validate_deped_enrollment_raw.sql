-- Bronze gate for deped_enrollment: runs after every load, over the whole table.
-- Each check writes one row to data_quality_results. The last statement fails
-- on any FAIL recorded for this run (including a batch's own checks), so
-- nothing downstream runs on an unreconciled table.
--
-- Parameters, supplied by the job (or the local CLI):
--   :run_id         the ingestion run being checked
--   :code_revision  the commit that ran, from the job parameter; never a literal

-- The same source row twice means a load ran twice without the MERGE guard.
