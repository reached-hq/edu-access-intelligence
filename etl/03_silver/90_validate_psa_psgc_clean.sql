-- Silver gate for psa_psgc. Generated from config/ingestion/psa_psgc.json
-- and config/mappings/psa_psgc.json by src/silver/psa_psgc.py:
--   python -m src.silver.cli gate --source psa_psgc > etl/03_silver/90_validate_psa_psgc_clean.sql
-- Do not edit by hand; tests/test_silver_psgc.py fails if it differs.
--
-- The job task after the Silver build. It checks the candidate tables the build wrote, one row
-- per check in data_quality_results: the whole build, then each current batch (one per quarter).
-- On any FAIL it records the run 'failed' and stops the task before publishing, so the Silver
-- tables keep the last build that passed and nothing downstream runs. Otherwise it copies the
-- candidates to the Silver tables and records the run 'succeeded'. PASS: as expected. WARN:
-- recorded, the build is published (quarantined rows). FAIL: the candidate cannot be trusted,
-- including any repeated PSGC code (D-019). Results hold counts, never row values.
--
-- Parameters, supplied by the job (or src/job/local_run.py):
--   :run_id         the job run that built the tables
--   :code_revision  the commit that ran, from the job parameter; never a literal

-- Only this execution's results decide: a repaired job run keeps its run_id, and the
-- results of an earlier attempt must not fail it again.
